# Nvim configurations

## Installation

1. Install Nvim
2. Install [a patched font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-installation) (`Hack Regular` works well); we need it for nvim plugins that use icons
3. Configure the font in the terminal emulator
4. Install `nvim`
5. Install `gcc` and `go`; we need them for some LSP tools
6. Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep); we need it for `:Telescope live_grep` and `grug-far.nvim`
7. Clone the repository to `~/.config` and run `nvim`
